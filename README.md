# Security Dashboard
This respository contains the projects I develop and resources I collect on my journey to learn more about cybersecurity. 

## Downloading Virtual Machine 

Downloaded the following Virtual Machine Manager: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads 

Downloaded the an ISO image from here to start: https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop 

## Packet Sniffer

A packet sniffer is a program that monitors packets flowing across a network, allowing users to view network traffic and diagnose issues

Originally, I was following a tutorial to build the packet sniffer, but it turned out that tutorial's approach only worked for Linux. This file is sniffer-linux-incomplete.py. I didn't finish it. 

The packet sniffer I developed should be OS-agnostic, but I know for a fact it works on MacOS. 

To run, navigate into the Packet-Sniffer directory and run the following command: 

```console
sudo python3 sniffer.py
```

## Port Scanner 

A port scanner is a software tool that probes a server or network to identify open ports, which are endpoints for network communication.
